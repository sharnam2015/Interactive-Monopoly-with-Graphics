Rules of the game - 
Basic rules can be read from the report itself. Specific rules are -
1) The buy function only gets activated when bank balance is less than 500$
2) The auction mode is activated when a player lands on a property but does not decide to buy it.
3) In case of Auction, if all players enter value less than half the value of property , the property is not sold to anyone.

We expect the players to remain truthful, and the play the game with full honesty and integrity
